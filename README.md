# Real-World Application of Search Algorithms
# Find the shorest path between two cities : 
This repository demonstrates how to find the shortest path between two cities using search algorithms on OpenStreetMap data. The project utilizes the osmnx library for graph construction and visualization, and the networkx library for implementing the A* search algorithm.
